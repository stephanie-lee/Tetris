A simple rendition of the popular tile-matching puzzle game.

This Tetris game was created using JavaScript to implement game logic and utilizes HTML canvas to draw the board and pieces. There are keypress listeners set for basic directions and piece rotations.

Future additions:
[] More menu functionality
[] Instructions, specifically key controls
[] Pieces should be allowed to rotate even if its full 3 x 3 grid is not on screen
